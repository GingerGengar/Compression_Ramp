The \url{Makefile} utility is used to build the binary of this project. The various functions are compiled independently of each other into object files. Then, they are compiled together to form the final binary. The script that automates this process is shown below. More complex cross-platform build tools might be available such as \url{CMake}. It seems that this project may be buildable on a unix-like system for now.
