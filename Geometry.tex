The functions implemented below are purely kinematic. They are based on basic trigonometry and basic algebraic manipulations of differential distances. The function \url{Pnts2Ang} is used when determining the wave angle of the oblique shock meanwhile the functions \url{Ang2Grad} and \url{dxComp} are used to determine the step in distance $x$ such that the length of the ramp $dl$ is preserved.
