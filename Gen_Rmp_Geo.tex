The function \url{GenRamp} uses a single loop which indicates marching forward in distance along the ramp geometry. Note that that the Mach number and the angle of the ramp geometry are sufficient parameters to characterize position on the ramp. All quantities can be derived from just those $2$ parameters. Knowing that, the function \url{XMarch} overwrites the $2$ parameters so that the numerical simulation can "march" in space.
