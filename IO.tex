The file handles the necessary data inputs and outputs. It is possible to use \url{printf} for variable output and using the \url{>} operator but since \url{C++} was used, the object-oriented method of logging data was used. Since the ramp geometry is $2$-dimensional, the ramp geometry could be fully described in its $x$ and $y$ coordiante. For simplicity, the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the rampare logged in $2$ different files.
\\~\\The parameter of the problem is printed in a separate file in case it needs to be referenced at a later time.
